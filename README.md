# Glaucoma-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
 Glaucoma, a progressive eye disease, often 
exhibits subtle symptoms that can easily go unnoticed until advanced stages. Traditional diagnostic methods, predominantly reliant on subjective assessments  and manual evaluation by ophthalmologists, suffer from inter-observer variability and the  potential for oversight. To address these limitations, deep learning model for glaucoma  detection is proposed.
